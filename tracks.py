        "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?",
        "response":
        "A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of AI model that is trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs are capable of various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text generation, question-answering, and more. GPT-3, developed by OpenAI, is an example of an LLM.
